## Overview
The QuickBooks Online Java SDK provides a set of Java class libraries that make it easier to call QuickBooks Online APIs, and access to QuickBooks Online data. Some of the features included in this SDK are:

* Ability to perform single and batch processing of CRUD operations on all QuickBooks Online entities.
* A common interface to the Request and Response Handler with two implemented classes to handle both synchronous and asynchronous requests.
* Support for both XML and JSON Request and Response format.
* Ability to configure app settings in the configuration file requiring no additional code change.
* Support for Gzip and Deflate compression formats to improve performance of Service calls to QuickBooks Online.
* Retry policy constructors to help apps handle transient errors.
* Logging mechanisms for trace and request/response logging.
* Sync APIs that assist with data synchronization between QuickBooks Desktop (Windows) and Intuit's cloud.
* Query Filters that enable you to write Intuit queries to retrieve QuickBooks Online entities whose properties meet a specified criteria.
* Queries for accessing QuickBooks Reports.
* Sparse Update to update writable properties specified in a request and leave the others unchanged.
* Change data that enables you to retrieve a list of entities modified during specified time points.

## Project Structure
* ipp-v3-java-data - contains all entities and entity dependencies that are used in data services operations
* ipp-v3-java-devkit - core component, contains rest API support
* ipp-v3-java-devkit-assembly - builds final deployment package (zip) which includes everything
* ipp-v3-java-devkit-shaded-assembly - builds lightweight version (some dependencies excluded)
* ipp-v3-java-devkit-javadoc - contains javadoc for data and devkit classes
* ipp-java-qbapihelper - contains Quickbooks API Helper methods for OAuth, Disconnect and Reconnect API

## System Requirements
The SDK works on JDK 1.6 and above.

## First Use Instructions
1. Clone the GitHub repo to your computer
2. Import it to the IDE of your choice

## Testing the code & building artifacts

To test the code locally, follow the steps below:

1. Update keys and tokens in [ippdevkit.properties](https://github.com/intuit/QuickBooks-V3-Java-SDK/blob/master/ipp-v3-java-devkit/src/test/resources/ippdevkit.properties) (Not sure how to get the tokens? Refer this [blog](https://developer.intuit.com/hub/blog/2016/04/25/quick-start-to-quickbooks-online-rest-api-with-oauth1-0) post to get on boarded with OAuth1 quickly.)

2. cd to the project directory
3. Run the command: `mvn install` - this will run the unit test, build the project and generate data & devkit jars

Note: To build out individual components such as ipp-v3-java-data.jar or ipp-v3-java-devkit.jar, remove parent dependency from the pom.xml of the respective projects and run maven install on the individual project folders.

## Release Notes:
Refer [Java SDK Release Notes](https://developer.intuit.com/docs/0100_quickbooks_online/0400_tools/0005_sdks/0200_java/0080_quickbooks_java_sdk_release_notes)
